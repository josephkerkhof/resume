\documentclass{article} % \documentclass{} is the first command in any LaTeX code.  It is used to define what kind of document you are creating such as an article or a book, and begins the document preamble

\title{Joseph Kerkhof's Resume} % Sets article title
\author{Joseph Kerkhof} % Sets authors name
\date{\today} % Sets date for date compiled

\begin{document} % All begin commands must be paired with an end command somewhere
    \maketitle % creates title using information in preamble (title, author, date)

    \section{Hello World!} % creates a section

    \textbf{Hello World!} Today I am learning \LaTeX. This is pretty neat.

\end{document} % This is the end of the document
